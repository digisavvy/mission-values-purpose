# About This Repository

This is our promise to the world and to our clients. As silly or bold as it is to make a global promise, that's all this is. A promise. 

It's a promise to each person who works at DigiSavvy, as a colleague, employee, friend, and contractor. It's a promise to every business and founder who has trusted us past, present, and future.

## What Now? Why Not?

I've operated DigiSavvy since 2010 and then full-time since 2014. I never bothered to think about my purpose. I just knew I loved doing what I did. 

A business isn't a living or breathing entity like you or I, it takes on the values of the people who steward the ship, so to speak. To that end, I thought about the qualities of the team I work with, of the clients we work with, and what we're trying to do. It all matters; it's all in the game.

It made sense to take stock of my values and how those translate into my company's values and the work we produce. If I'm going to spend most of my waking hours thinking about and working on the business, if I'm going to convince my team and our clients to go "all-in" it had better be something that means something. 

This is my attempt at giving voice to the fire in my belly. I hope it resonates with someone some day. Steal it and make it yours but more importantly _live_ your principles in every widget sold, in ever customer helped, in every relationship you make.
