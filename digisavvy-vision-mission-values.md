# DigiSavvy: Vission, Mission, Values, Critical Actions, and Purpose

## Vision
<sub><sup>What DigiSavvy aspires to...</sub></sup>
To instigate the potential and success of every business we work with so they can be a force for good in their community.

## Purpose
<sub><sup>This is what fuels our drive every day.</sub></sup>

To Get Your Business Where It’s Growing.

## Mission Statement
<sub><sup>This is our promise to the world; to our clients.</sub></sup> 

We handle the small technical things for our clients, ensuring they reclaim their time and focus on doing the big picture things like growing their businesses and inspiring their communities.

## Story Pitch
<sub><sup>This is the story our clients are living when they reach out to us. They don’t reach out because things are peachy. Things are pretty fucky by the time they fill-out our intake form. </sub></sup>

When the mission-critical tools and platforms a business relies on everyday fail to work, it creates losses of revenue, customers, and precious time.
If business owners must spend time figuring out why their online stuff isn’t working, it takes time and energy away from growing their business’s success.

DigiSavvy helps businesses by leveraging smart ideas, proven expertise, and effective technology that reclaim their time, sanity, and get them where they’re growing.

## Values
<sub><sup>These are the values I want DigiSavvy to uphold as an organization. I want them to drive our decision making processes. We live these individually and as an organization.</sub></sup>

* We believe that sharing our best ideas and participating in our community is the best way to empower its growth and sustainability.

* We believe in the power of Open Source to allow businesses, no matter how small, to compete on a large scale.\

* Do the right thing when no one is looking.

* Own our mistakes and be accountable.

## Key Characteristics
<sub><sup>Individually, we all possess these qualities in some form. We know that to be human is to be unfinished and to be in progress always. And that is okay.</sub></sup>

* Coachable and Humble: We understand we don’t always have the answers. We support one another, collaborate, share, and pull one another forward. 


* Service Driven: We approach every conversation with, “How can I help?” We’re humans in service of other humans.


* Adaptable and Accountable: We are not scared of change. We do not fear failure. We accept failure when it happens. We work to understand, learn, and overcome obstacles as a team.


* Uplifting and Supportive: We are a team, a small family and we are there for one another. Personal and mental well-being is paramount.

## Critical Actions
<sub><sup>As an organization we are expected to be inclusive by default; clear and communicative; curious; fun-having and action-oriented.</sub></sup>

* Inclusion-oriented: Community is important. We believe participation and outreach are integral to foster growth for all. We welcome diverse perspectives which drive our work and our goals.


* We are clear: We aim to move our business and clients forward. We do that with clear communication and expectations. 


* We are curious: We’re eager to learn and to try new things. When we stop learning we stop growing.


* We do the thing: Thoughtful actions on purpose. Be present; do_action.
